                <p>The map below demonstrates the feasibility of biking to various Toronto universities. 
                    Its base map style is an extension upon the Mapbox "Outdoors" style, 
                    which displays hillshading and terrain contours that can aid bikers in judging the possibility of cycling over various relief. 
                    The base map colors are modified to only distinguish various forms of greenspace from water and other general land:
                    color distinctions between residential, commercial, industrial areas, hospitals, municipal buildings, etc. are removed
                    as found unecessary for the purpose of this map. "Places of interest", transit, as well as administrative labels 
                    are also removed (only road labels are kept) to allow focus on the overlaid data of the map. Opacity and color of terrain features
                    are also modified to accentuate relief, and zoom levels are edited such that the latter only appear past zoom level 13. 
                    <br>2 data layers are displayed on this map: a cycling network geojson and a geojson highlighting the central location of
                    5 universities in Toronto. The first is downloaded from 
                    <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bikeways/">Open Data Toronto</a> in the form of a geojson,
                    and contains bikeways of the city in the form of linestrings, while the second is created using
                    <a href="https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20">geojson.io</a> and contains 5 points representing the 5 universities. 
                    The former is imported as type "line", while the latter is imported as type "symbol" (such that it displays labels with the 
                    names of the schools as opposed to points of the schools' locations). The symbology of these data are edited using the 
                    Mapbox 'paint' and 'layout' layer properties. Additionally, custom markers are added to the university locations.

                <p>The map below demonstrates the feasibility of taking public transit to various Toronto universities.
                    Its base map style is an extension upon the Mapbox "Monochrome" style, 
                    which displays a grayscale view that eases the visibility of any labels and icons placed atop it. The base map colors
                    are modified to distinguish between greenspace (as a whole), water, and other general land: color distinctions between 
                    residential, commercial, industrial areas, hospitals, municipal buildings, etc. are removed as found unecessary for the 
                    purpose of this map. "Places of interest" as well as administrative labels are also removed, to allow focus on the 
                    overlaid data layers, as well as the public transit labels and road labels which are kept. The public transit labels' colors are modified 
                    to aid them in standing out, icons are added to allow visual disntinction amongst various forms of transit, and zoom levels
                    are modified such that the symbols appear only past zoom level 12.
                    <br>2 data layers are displayed on this map: a subway network geojson and a geojson highlighting the central location of
                    5 universities in Toronto. The first is downloaded from 
                    <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-shapefiles/">Open Data Toronto</a>
                    as a shapefile, and is converted manually to geojson through GIS software. It contains subway routes of the city 
                    in the form of linestrings. The second is created using <a href="https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20">geojson.io</a> and contains 5 
                    points representing the 5 universities. The former is imported as type "line", while the latter is imported as type "symbol" 
                    (such that it displays labels with the names of the schools as opposed to points of the schools' locations). The symbology of these 
                    data are edited using the Mapbox 'paint' and 'layout' layer properties. Additionally, custom markers are added to the university locations.

                <p>The map below demonstrates the feasibility of driving to various Toronto universities.
                    Its base map style is an extension upon the Mapbox "Navigation-Light" style, 
                    which displays the traffic condition on roads. The base map colors are modified to specify the colorscale of low-severe
                    traffic, and to distinguish between greenspace (as a whole), water, and other general land: color distinctions between 
                    residential, commercial, industrial areas, hospitals, municipal buildings, etc. are removed as found unecessary for the 
                    purpose of this map. "Places of interest", transit, as well as administrative labels are also removed to allow focus on the 
                    overlaid data layers, the traffic conditions, and the road labels which are kept.
                    <br>2 data layers are displayed on this map: a parking lots vector layer and a geojson highlighting the central location of
                    5 universities in Toronto. The first is downloaded from 
                    <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/topographic-mapping-physical-area-of-parking-lots/">Open Data Toronto</a> as 
                    a shapefile, is converted manually to geojson through GIS software, then uploaded as a tileset to Mapbox to be usable as a vector layer.
                    It contains parking lots of the city in the form of polygons which appear on the map at zoom levels past 13. The second is created using 
                    <a href="https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20">geojson.io</a> and contains 5 points representing the 5 universities. The former is imported as 
                    type "fill", while the latter is imported as type "symbol" (such that it displays labels with the names of the schools as opposed to points 
                    of the schools' locations). The symbology of these data are edited using the Mapbox 'paint' and 'layout' layer properties.
